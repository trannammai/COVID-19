***Disclaimer***   
*Most sections in this repository are under active development and may be incomplete.
Information posted in this repository was created by those listed as creators in the metadata and not by the MIDAS Coordination Center. Creators should be acknowledged when using the information for scientific or other work (see [Information for Users](#userinfo))*.


### Introduction 
This repository serves as a central platform to share resources relevant for modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak. The [MIDAS Coordination Center (MCC)](https://midasnetwork.us/mcc/) has created and will maintain it in collaboration with the broader modeling community. Community members are encouraged to contribute resources to the repository and thus support the overall COVID-19 research effort. See [Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors) for guidance on how to contribute material. Contact questions@midasnetwork.us for any questions or ideas for improvements, or to send/request any material to be included. 

### MIDAS 2019 Novel Coronavirus Mailing List
The MIDAS Coordination Center maintains a dedicated mailing list for updates and news about COVID-19 modeling research. To join the mailing list, please email questions@midasnetwork.us. 

### Community contributions
We highly encourage community member to contribute to COVID-19 repository and we would like to acknowledged those that send us data, papers, links or pointed us to resources. Please find below a short presentation of each of them and a summary of their contributions to the repository:

## Data
### <ins>[Data Curation Tracker](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Data-curation-tracker)</ins>
All data sources relevant for COVID-19 modeling can be uploaded/found here, including case count data and line listings. Data can be in many different formats and levels of curation. The sources by country are listed in a curation tracking table indicating the data available or in the process of being published in the repository. We encourage everybody who wants to contribute to the repository to send resources not yet listed in this table or not yet extracted so we can add it to our workflow to avoid duplication. See [Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors) for more information. 

### <ins>[Data Catalog](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Data-catalog)</ins>
All data published in the repository are uploaded/found here. Data are uploaded by the MCC and by community members. Sets of related data files are presented as "collections". For example, a collection can be a set of related outbreak situation updates from a country, a set of time-stamped backup files, or another set of related files. Each collection has its own metadata, data guide, and location dictionary that maps geographic locations listed in the collection to international standards. 

## <ins>[Parameter Estimates](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus)</ins>
Parameter estimates are stored in one CSV file with estimates for epidemiological parameters relevant for nCoV modeling. Estimates are extracted from a variety of sources including preliminary model reports, pre-prints, and peer-reviewed publications. For each parameter, metadata are also extracted. Parameter estimates are extracted by a team of curators from the MIDAS Coordination Center and community members. A subset of the CSV file is displayed in a README file. New parameter estimates can be added by appending to the CSV file (see [Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors)).

### <ins>[Parameter Estimates for 2019 Novel Coronavirus](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus)</ins>

### Parameter Estimates for MERS

## <ins>[Software Tools](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/software_tools)</ins>
Software tools for data-processing, modeling, and visualizations will be included in this section together with relevant metadata. One CSV catalog file includes all tools, each on a separate row, and all tools are listed [here](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/blob/master/software_tools/README.md). New tools can be added by appending to the [CSV file](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/blob/master/software_tools/software_catalog.csv) or by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/issues). 

## <ins>[Documents](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Documents)</ins>
All documents relevant to COVID-19 are posted in this section. Documents are mostly organized by country or by topic. Pre-prints and peer-reviewd manuscripts are posted with links to external webpages only while all other documents are also stored in this repository as collections in the [documents folder](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/documents). Add new documents by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/issues) with the document information.

Documents include:
* Reports, inlcuding outbreak situation reports/updates, modeling reports and other "gray literature"
* Pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications, organized by topic
* Guidelines by WHO, China, and US CDC related to COVID-19

## <ins>[Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors)</ins>
